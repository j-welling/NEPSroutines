Description: This package contains a collection of functions for the
    scaling of NEPS competence data. It is based on standardized scaling
    scripts and comprises 1PL and 2PL analyses for binary and polytomous
    data, descriptives, missing values, distractor, dimensionality and DIF
    analyses as well as scores and SUF creation.  Additionally it provides
    functions for data preparation and data checks.  Next to providing
    functions for analysis, the package may also include functionalities
    for progress reports in the future.
