Description: This package contains a collection of functions for the scaling 
    of NEPS competence data. It is based on standardized scaling scripts and 
    comprises Rasch and 2PL analyses for binary and polytomous data, distractor, 
    dimensionality and DIF analyses as well as missing values analyses.
    Next to providing functions for analysis, the package may also include 
    functionalities for progress reports in the future.
