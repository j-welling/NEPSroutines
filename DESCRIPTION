Description: This package contains a collection of functions for the scaling 
    of NEPS competence data. It is based on standardized scaling scripts and 
    comprises 1PL and 2PL analyses for binary and polytomous data, descriptives, missing values,
    distractor, dimensionality and DIF analyses as well as scores and SUF creation.
    Additionally it provides functions for data preparation and data checks.
    Next to providing functions for analysis, the package may also include 
    functionalities for progress reports in the future.
