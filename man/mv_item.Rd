\arguments{
\item{resp}{data.frame; contains item responses with items as variables and
persons as rows; all responses ∈ ℕ0; user-defined missing values;
includes all variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{vars}{data.frame; contains information about items with items as rows;
includes variable 'item' containing item names; additionally includes all
variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{select}{string; defines name of logical variable in vars that indicates
which items to use for the analysis}

\item{valid}{string; defines name of logical variable in resp that indicates
(in)valid cases}

\item{position}{(named) character vector; defines name(s) of integer
variable(s) in vars that indicate position of items; if groups with differing
item positions in testlets exist, then vector must be named with names of
groups (as in "grouping") as names of elements and names of variables as elements}

\item{grouping}{character vector; contains for each group a name of a logical
variable in resp and vars that indicates to which group belongs a person or
an item}

\item{mvs}{named integer vector; contains user-defined missing values}

\item{labels_mvs}{named character vector; contains labels for user-defined
missing values to use them in plot titles and printed results}

\item{plots}{logical; whether plots shall be created and saved to hard drive}

\item{print}{logical; whether results shall be printed to console}

\item{save}{logical; whether results shall be saved to hard drive}

\item{return}{logical; whether results shall be returned}

\item{path_results}{string; defines path to folder where results shall be saved}

\item{path_table}{string; defines path to folder where tables shall be saved}

\item{path_plots}{string; defines path to folder where plots shall be saved}

\item{show_all}{logical; whether whole sample shall be included as a "group"
(only applicable when grouping exists)}

\item{name_grouping}{string; name of the grouping variable (e.g. test version)
for title and legend of plots (only needed when grouping exists)}

\item{overwrite}{logical; whether to overwrite existing file when saving table}

\item{digits}{integer; number of decimals for rounding}

\item{warn}{logical; whether to print warnings (should be better set to true)}

\item{verbose}{logical; whether to print processing information to console}

\item{labels_legend}{character vector; contains legend labels}
}
\value{
(if return = TRUE) list with results:
         mvlist: percentages for each item
         mvsum: summary statistics across items
         summary_table: table with summary statistics for TR
