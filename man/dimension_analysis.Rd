\arguments{
\item{resp}{data.frame. contains:
(1) the responses. y in {0, 1} for binary data and y in
  {0, 1, ... k-1} for polytomous responses with k categories
(2) ID_t: column indicating ID of participants}

\item{vars}{data.frame with all variables as rows with at least the
following columns:
items: contains name for each item (scored and unscored)
and a column identifying item subsets for the analyses and
one for the item scoring}

\item{items}{character. contains name of variable (boolean) in vars that
indicates which items to use for analysis.}

\item{scoring}{character. Contains the name of the variable in vars that
indicates the variable used for scoring. Defaults to
"scoring"}

\item{dim}{character vector. contains names of all dimension variables
that shall be analyzed (NOTE: the dimensions must be
coded as integers from 1 to the number of dimensions!)}

\item{valid}{character string. defines name of boolean variable in dat,
indicating (in)valid cases.}

\item{irtmodel}{the choice of irtmodel as passed to the TAM function}

\item{maxiter}{max iterations as passed to the TAM function}

\item{snodes}{snodes as passed to the TAM function}

\item{verbose}{verbose as passed to the TAM function}
}
