\title{Dichotomous NEPS data without booklets}
\format{
A list with two data frames including the simulated responses
(`resp`) and the characteristics of the variables (`vars`).

`resp` is a data frame with 1,010 rows and 35 columns:
\describe{
  \item{ID_t}{Unique identifier for respondent.}
  \item{sex}{Sex with 0 = male and 1 = female.}
  \item{mig}{Migrant background with 0 = no and 1 = yes.}
  \item{school}{School type with 0 = lower, 1 = intermediate, and 1 = upper.}
  \item{grk1..._c}{Scored item responses 0 = incorrect and 1 = correct.}
  \item{grk1...}{Unscored item responses for simple multiple-choice items
  with values of 1 to 4 representing the selected response option.}
  \item{valid}{A logical vector identifying valid respondents.}
}

`vars` is a data frame with 30 rows and 8 columns:
\describe{
  \item{item}{Name of the item.}
  \item{raw}{A logical distinguishing scored (`FALSE`) and unscored (`TRUE`)
  items.}
  \item{dich}{A logical identifying scored dichotomous (`TRUE`) and
  other (`FALSE`) items.}
  \item{type}{A string identifying the item type as simple multiple-choice
   (`MC`) or complex multiple-choice (`CMC`).}
  \item{scoring}{A number with the scoring weight in the item response
  analyses.}
  \item{num_cat}{A number with the number of response categories.}
  \item{pos}{A number with the item position in the test.}
  \item{correct}{A number between 1 and 4 representing the correct response
  option for simple multiple-choice items.}
}
