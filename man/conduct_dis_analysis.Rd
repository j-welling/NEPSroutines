\arguments{
\item{resp}{data.frame; contains item responses with items as variables and
persons as rows; y in {0, 1} for binary data and y in {0, 1, ... k-1} for
polytomous responses with k categories; missing values (default -999 to -1)
are coded as NA internally; additionally includes ID_t as a person identifier
and all variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{vars}{data.frame; contains information about items with items as rows;
includes variables 'item' (character) containing item names and all variables
that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{valid}{string; defines name of logical variable in resp that indicates
(in)valid cases}

\item{select_raw}{string; defines name of logical variable in vars that
indicates all raw items that shall be used for the distractor analysis}

\item{select_score}{string; defines name of logical variable in vars that
indicates all items that shall be used to caculate total score}

\item{correct}{string; defines name of variable in vars that contains the
correct responses to the items}

\item{mvs}{named integer vector; contains user-defined missing values}

\item{save}{logical; whether results shall be saved to hard drive}

\item{name_group}{string; defines name of group used in analysis (e.g. 'easy')}

\item{path}{string; indicates the folder location where the results
are stored on the hard drive; please note that the path is relative to the
current working path set by here::i_am()}

\item{digits}{integer; number of decimals for rounding}

\item{warn}{logical; whether to print warnings (should be set to TRUE)}
}
\value{
list with one data frame per item containing item-total correlations
  for each possible response; correct response is marked with an *.
}
\description{
Calculates the item-rest correlations of distractor and correct responses
