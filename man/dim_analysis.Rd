\arguments{
\item{resp}{data.frame; contains item responses with items as variables and
persons as rows; y in {0, 1} for binary data and y in {0, 1, ... k-1} for
polytomous responses with k categories; missing values (default -999 to -1)
are coded as NA internally; additionally includes ID_t as a person identifier
and all variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{vars}{data.frame; contains information about items with items as rows;
includes variable 'item' containing item names; additionally includes all
variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{select}{string; defines name of logical variable in vars that indicates
which items to use for the analysis}

\item{scoring}{string; defines name of numerical variable in vars that
contains the scoring factor to be applied to loading matrix; defaults to
"scoring"}

\item{dim}{character vector. contains names of all dimension variables
that shall be analyzed (NOTE: the dimensions must be coded as integers from 1
to the number of dimensions!)}

\item{valid}{string; defines name of logical variable in resp that indicates
(in)valid cases}

\item{mvs}{named integer vector; contains user-defined missing values}

\item{irtmodel}{string; "1PL" for Rasch, "2PL" for 2PL, "PCM2" for PCM and
"GPCM" for GPCM analysis}

\item{maxiter}{max iterations as passed to the TAM function}

\item{snodes}{snodes as passed to the TAM function}

\item{return}{logical; whether results shall be returned}

\item{save}{logical; whether results shall be saved to hard drive}

\item{print}{logical; whether results shall be printed to console}

\item{path_results}{string; defines path to folder where results shall be saved}

\item{path_table}{string; defines path to folder where tables shall be saved}

\item{overwrite}{logical; whether to overwrite existing file when saving table}

\item{verbose}{verbose as passed to the TAM function}
}
