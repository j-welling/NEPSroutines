\arguments{
\item{resp}{data.frame; contains item responses with items as variables and
persons as rows; y in {0, 1} for binary data and y in {0, 1, ... k-1} for
polytomous responses with k categories; missing values (default -999 to -1)
are coded as NA internally; additionally includes ID_t as a person identifier
and all variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{vars}{data.frame; contains information about items with items as rows;
includes variable 'item' containing item names; additionally includes all
variables that are further defined in the function arguments}

\item{select}{string; defines name of logical variable in vars that indicates
which items to use for the analysis}

\item{valid}{string; defines name of logical variable in resp that indicates
(in)valid cases}

\item{mvs}{named integer vector; contains user-defined missing values}

\item{missing_by_design}{numeric; user defined missing value for missing by
design (is necessary for calculating N_administered)}

\item{scoring}{string; defines name of numerical variable in vars that
contains the scoring factor to be applied to loading matrix; can be NULL for
Rasch model}

\item{plots}{logical; whether plots shall be created and saved to hard drive}

\item{save}{logical; whether results shall be saved to hard drive}

\item{print}{logical; whether results shall be printed to console}

\item{return}{logical; whether results shall be returned}

\item{path_plots}{string; defines path to folder where plots shall be saved}

\item{path_table}{string; defines path to folder where tables shall be saved}

\item{path_results}{string; defines path to folder where results shall be saved}

\item{overwrite}{logical; whether to overwrite existing file when saving table}

\item{digits}{integer; number of decimals for rounding}

\item{name_group}{string; defines name of group used in analysis (e.g. 'easy')}

\item{verbose}{logical; whether to print processing information to console}

\item{warn}{logical; whether to print warnings (should be set to TRUE to
avoid problems with the data structure)}

\item{test}{logical; whether to test data structure (should be set to TRUE)}

\item{xsi_fixed_1p}{named numerical vector; contains fixed item difficulties
for one parameter model as elements and item names as names of elements}

\item{xsi_fixed_2p}{named numerical vector; contains fixed item difficulties
for two parameter model as elements and item names as names of elements}

\item{pweights}{character; defines name of numerical variable in resp that
contains person weights as passed to TAM-function}

\item{control_tam}{list; control argument as passed to tam.mml-functions}

\item{control_wle}{list; can contain Msteps and/or convM as to pass to tam.wle()
as elements of the list}
}
\value{
(if return = TRUE) list with all results:
            model.1pl/model.pcm: results of irt analysis with one parameter
            model.2pl/model.gpcm: results of irt analysis with two parameters
          (depending on function arguments / type of analysis) +
            summary: table with results for TR
            model_fit: table with goodness of fit indicators for all mdoels
            steps: table with results of steps analysis (only for polytomous analysis)
}
\description{
Perform 1PL and 2PL analyses for binary or PCM and GPCM analyses for
polytomous data, generate summary and plots.
